This dataset was constructed based on the real-world data from one of the busiest international airport in China. The dataset involves multi-station observation data and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data for fine-grained wind prediction. The observation and NWP data are located in the directories of `obs/` and `nwp/`, respectively. There are nine groups of observation data (corresponding to 9 `.csv` files) and one group of NWP data (corresponding to a `.csv` file) shared to the whole airfield. Both types of data are hourly time series of weather variables collected from 2018-03-02:00:00:00 to 2019-09- 01-23:00:00 with a total of 13,176 time points (24 points per day).  Missing values in the observation data are represented by a number of -9999. The weather variables include wind speed (`SPD10`), lateral wind speed (`U10`), longitudinal wind speed (`V10`), wind direction (`DIR10`), temperature (`T2`), relative humidity (`RH2`), and sea-level pressure (`SLP`). Note that the values of `U10` and `V10` in the observation data are calculated from`SPD10` and `DIR10` as they cannot be measured directly.
