The observation and NWP data are located in the directories of `obs/` and `nwp/`, respectively. There are nine groups of observation data (corresponding to 9 `.csv` files) and one group of NWP data (corresponding to a `.csv` file) shared to the whole airfield.  Missing values in the observation data are represented by a number of `-9999`. The weather variables include wind speed (`V`), lateral wind speed (`VX`), longitudinal wind speed (`VY`), wind direction (`DIR`), temperature (`TP`), relative humidity (`RH`), and sea-level pressure (`SLP`). Note that the values of `VX` and `VY` in the observation data are calculated from `V` and `DIR` as they cannot be measured directly.
